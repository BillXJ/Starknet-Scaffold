## USAGE

### Contract Section

The `contract` folder contains all the tools needed to write, build, test and deploy your Starknet smart contracts. It is built with Scarb and Starknet Foundry. Here are common operations you can perform on your contracts:

#### Build contracts

To build your smart contracts, from the base repository run:

```
npm run build-contracts
```

#### Format contracts

Scarb comes with an in-built cairo formatter. To utilize it run:

```
npm run format-contracts
```

#### Test contracts

To run your tests:

```
npm run test-contracts
```

#### Generate an SRC-5 interface ID for your contracts

To generate an interface ID, run:

```
npm run generate-interface <PATH_TO_INTERFACE>
```

#### Prepare Account for deployment

To prepare your account for deployment, run:

```
npm run prepare-account --url=<RPC_URL> --name=<ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

generates a profile which is added to `scarb.toml` and can be passed to other commands.

#### Deploy Account

To deploy an account:

```
npm run deploy-account --profile=<MY_PROFILE> --name=<ACCOUNT_NAME> --maxfee=<MAX_FEE>
```

where the `profile` is gotten from `scarb.toml`, `name` is the prepared account and `maxfee` is the specified max fee.

#### Delete Account

To delete an account:

```
npm run delete-account --url=<RPC_URL> --name=<ACCOUNT_NAME> --network=<alpha-mainnet | alpha-goerli>
```

#### Declare Contract

To declare a contract:

```
npm run declare-contract --profile=<MY_PROFILE> --contract=<CONTRACT_NAME>
```

#### Deploy Contract

To deploy a contract:

```
npm run deploy-contract --profile=<MY_PROFILE> --classhash=<CONTRACT_CLASSHASH>
```

### UI SECTION

The `frontend` section contains all UI components. Built using NextJS, Starknet.js, Starknet-React, Starknetkit, and Typescript.

#### Run UI

To run UI, from the base repository:

```
npm run start
```

#### Build UI

To build your frontend, from the base repository run:

```
npm run build-ui
```
